Q6. State the basic difference between an interface and an abstract class (common for every group).
Ans:1)Abstract class contains both abstract as well non-abstract method while Interface contains only 
	  abstract method.
	2)Abstract class can have constructors while interface do not have constructor.
	3)We can declare variables in abstract class but we cannot declare variables in interface.

Q8. State the difference between Database methods for DML and basic DML statements.
Ans:Basic difference between DML statements and Database methods is:
	1)When we use DML statements like simple Insert, it can insert either all the records or no records at all. 
	  Partial success is not possible.
	2)But when we use database methods like Database.insert(listname,false),partial success is possible in this case.
	  i.e. if there we are inserting 10 records and there is error in one record then 9 records will be inserted and
	  one of them will face failure.
	3)While Database.insert(listname,true) Operates same like simple insert DML i.e no partial success possible.
